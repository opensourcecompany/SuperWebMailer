# SuperWebMailer
An (actually) obfuscated newsletter script, which clearly violated the GPL.
Obfuscated code, not shipping the GPL license with the product, telling it is all custom coding...

Unfortunately the origninal author missed the part where the GPL 2.0 says:
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.en.html#IfLibraryIsGPL

Thanks to @sergejmueller for his captcha library ;-)

So, the actual version is a messy obfuscated piece of code but it works!
(no wonder, heavily using LGPL modules glued together)

Feel free to start de-obfuscating...
